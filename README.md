# Node.js Fullstack Practice Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **Node.js Fullstack Practice Repo**! This repository contains a series of full-stack projects where I'm learning and implementing how frontend and backend work together using:

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

---

## 🎯 Aim of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

- Practice building **real-world full-stack applications**
- Strengthen my understanding of how to create and consume **custom APIs**
- Learn how to **connect React with backend services**
- Practice **project structuring**, clean code, and **deployment**

Each project will be stored in a separate folder within this repo.
