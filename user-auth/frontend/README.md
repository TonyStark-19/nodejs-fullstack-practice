#  🔐 User Authentication Frontend

This is the **frontend**  part of the **User Authentication App** built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
It connects to a **Node.js + Express** backend and uses **MongoDB** to handle user registration, login, and logout with cookie-based authentication.
